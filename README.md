Our wine stock management application is a stand alone app which helps us track sales, stocks and suppliers
As a user you can have different roles: admin, manager or salesperson
This app doesn't include register of signup form because we based our analysis on the fact that an admin is the one creating an account for you when you become a new employee of the stock dept.
As soon as he creates it using the user management panel, he offers the new employee the credentials so that he can login.
Later this new employee can manage his profile by changing username and/or password
While running the project is advisable to start runing the loginFrame.java file from there you will be redirected to a dedicated dashboard
